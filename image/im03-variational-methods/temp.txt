Hello Vincent, how are you? I hope you are enjoying the end of the year ðŸ˜„

I am currently in Belgium with my family and we have a question regarding Brussels.

We rented a car in Lille, France, and we are not sure if we can enter the Low Emission Zone in Brussels.
Do you know if we have to do something before entering the city? Or would it be best to just leave the car in some parking lot outside the LEZ?
We are in Bruges right now and will be going to Brussels tomorrow.

Thanks anyways and see you soon!
