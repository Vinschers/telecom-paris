Testing a state-of-the-art nnUNet method on the ACDC dataset

The ASCENT is a project developed by Hang Jung Ling: https://github.com/creatis-myriad/ASCENT
In this repo, the nnU-Net state-of-the-art method has been developed using the following python libraries: pytorch / pytorch lightning / hydra / monai
There's a jupyter notebook (notebooks/acdc.py) that lets you train and test the nnUNet method directly from the ACDC dataset.
