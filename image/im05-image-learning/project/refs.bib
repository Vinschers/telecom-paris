    abstract = "In this paper, we propose a fully automatic method for
                segmentation of left ventricle, right ventricle and myocardium
                from cardiac Magnetic Resonance (MR) images using densely
                connected fully convolutional neural network. Dense Convolutional
                neural network (DenseNet) facilitates multi-path flow for
                gradients between layers during training by back-propagation and
                feature propagation. DenseNet also encourages feature reuse {\&}
                thus substantially reduces the number of parameters while
                maintaining good performance, which is ideal in scenarios with
                limited data. The training data was subjected to Fourier analysis
                and classical computer vision (CV) techniques for Region of
                Interest (ROI) extraction. The parameters of the network were
                optimized by training with a dual cost function i.e. weighted
                cross-entropy and Dice co-efficient. For the task of automated
                heart diagnosis, cardiac parameters such as ejection fraction,
                volumes of ventricles etc. where calculated from segmentation
                masks predicted by the network at the end systole and diastole
                phases. Further these parameters were used as features to train a
                Random forest classifier. On the exclusively held-out test set
                (10{\%} of training set) the proposed method for segmentation
                task achieved a mean dice score of 0.92, 0.87 and 0.86 for left
                ventricle, right ventricle and myocardium respectively. For
                automated cardiac disease diagnosis, the Random Forest classifier
                achieved an accuracy of 90{\%}.",

abstract="Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging improves on diagnosis of cardiovascular diseases by providing images at high spatiotemporal resolution. Manual evaluation of these time-series, however, is expensive and prone to biased and non-reproducible outcomes. In this paper, we present a method that addresses named limitations by integrating segmentation and disease classification into a fully automatic processing pipeline. We use an ensemble of UNet inspired architectures for segmentation of cardiac structures such as the left and right ventricular cavity (LVC, RVC) and the left ventricular myocardium (LVM) on each time instance of the cardiac cycle. For the classification task, information is extracted from the segmented time-series in form of comprehensive features handcrafted to reflect diagnostic clinical procedures. Based on these features we train an ensemble of heavily regularized multilayer perceptrons (MLP) and a random forest classifier to predict the pathologic target class. We evaluated our method on the ACDC dataset (4 pathology groups, 1 healthy group) and achieve dice scores of 0.945 (LVC), 0.908 (RVC) and 0.905 (LVM) in a cross-validation over the training set (100 cases) and 0.950 (LVC), 0.923 (RVC) and 0.911 (LVM) on the test set (50 cases). We report a classification accuracy of {\$}{\$}94 {\backslash}{\%}{\$}{\$}94{\%}on a training set cross-validation and {\$}{\$}92{\backslash}{\%}{\$}{\$}92{\%}on the test set. Our results underpin the potential of machine learning methods for accurate, fast and reproducible segmentation and computer-assisted diagnosis (CAD).",
