1. Which steps would you change to make the algorithm work with 3-dimensional data (voxels)?
2. After computing db, the authors use scalar and vector weights to determine the parameters of transformation. Why they do that? What these weights represent?
3. How does the algorithm deal with noise when it is computing dX?
